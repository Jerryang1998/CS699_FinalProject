# CS699_FinalProject
CS 699 - Data Mining
Project Outline
 Choose a dataset, define a data mining goal (classification), and submit a
proposal.
 Proposal approved.
 Perform appropriate preprocessing as needed.
 Select five classification algorithms.
 For each classification algorithm, build a classification model and test it using 10-
fold cross-validation, and collect and keep the performance result (details will be
discussed later).
 Split the preprocessed dataset into a training dataset and a test dataset.
 Choose five attribution selection methods and prepare five reduced training
datasets.
 From each reduced training dataset, build five classification models (using the
five classification algorithms you selected) and test them on the corresponding
reduced test dataset.
 Now, you have built and tested 25 classification models.
 Compare them and select one model as your best model.
 Compare the performance of your best model with the performance of the model
that was built using the same classification algorithm from the dataset with all
attributes (the dataset after preprocessing).
