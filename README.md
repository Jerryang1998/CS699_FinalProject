# CS699_FinalProject
CS 699 - Data Mining <br/><br/>
Project Outline<br/>
1. Choose a dataset, define a data mining goal (classification), and submit a
proposal. <br/>
2. Proposal approved.<br/>
3. Perform appropriate preprocessing as needed.<br/>
4. Select five classification algorithms.<br/>
5. For each classification algorithm, build a classification model and test it using 10-
fold cross-validation, and collect and keep the performance result (details will be
discussed later).<br/>
6. Split the preprocessed dataset into a training dataset and a test dataset.<br/>
7. Choose five attribution selection methods and prepare five reduced training
datasets.<br/>
8. From each reduced training dataset, build five classification models (using the
five classification algorithms you selected) and test them on the corresponding
reduced test dataset.<br/>
9. Now, you have built and tested 25 classification models.<br/>
10. Compare them and select one model as your best model.<br/>
11. Compare the performance of your best model with the performance of the model
that was built using the same classification algorithm from the dataset with all
attributes (the dataset after preprocessing). <br/><br/>
Detailed requirements are given below.
You choose a real world dataset, define your own data mining goal (a classification), and
perform necessary data mining tasks to achieve the goal. It is strongly suggested that you
choose a data mining goal that has a potential for practical use. It is also strongly
suggested that you find a “fresh” dataset, which, to the best of your knowledge, was
rarely used by other people. You should not select a synthetically generated dataset and
you should not use a dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository. You must also
avoid using a dataset on the Kaggle website that has been used by many people. You may
want to check government (federal, state, or municipal) websites.
